Introducing the AIS Google Map Viewer: A Powerful Tool for AIS Data Visualization and Testing
Are you working with AIS (Automatic Identification System) data and looking for a reliable, customizable, and user-friendly tool to visualize and test ship positions in real time? Look no further! Iâ€™m excited to introduce the AIS Google Map Viewer, an open-source application designed to streamline AIS data visualization and testing.
What is the AIS Google Map Viewer?
The AIS Google Map Viewer is a Python-based application that connects to an AIS server, decodes real-time ship data, and displays it on an interactive Google Map. Itâ€™s a versatile tool that allows users to:
â€¢	Visualize ship positions in real time with customizable markers.
â€¢	Track specific ships by their MMSI (Maritime Mobile Service Identity) number.
â€¢	Configure AIS server settings (IP, port) and Google Maps API key directly from the interface.
â€¢	Test and debug AIS data with detailed ship information, including status, speed, course, and heading.
Key Features
â€¢	Real-Time Updates: The application fetches and processes AIS data continuously, ensuring up-to-date ship positions.
â€¢	Customizable Interface: Users can configure the AIS server, Google API key, and target MMSI values to suit their needs.
â€¢	Interactive Map: Built with Google Maps API, the map provides a seamless and intuitive user experience.
â€¢	Open Source: The tool is fully open source, allowing developers to extend, modify, and contribute to its development.
Who Is It For?
The AIS Google Map Viewer is perfect for:
â€¢	Maritime professionals who need to monitor ship movements.
â€¢	Developers working on AIS-related applications and tools.
â€¢	Testers who require a reliable platform to validate AIS data.
â€¢	Researchers studying maritime traffic patterns.
